## Welcome to My Blog.
After reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, I have decided to build what I’m coining as a Habitually Automated System for Engaged Learning (HASEL), where I will research at least one interesting subject per week (outside of those encountered in daily, academic, or professional endeavours).

This blog will serve as: 1. an instrument by which the learning system is constructed and used, and 2. a progress and accountability tracker.

## Hypothesis
The idea of a system that, once implemented, would allow the user to drastically improve their cognitive function, speaking both in terms of storage capacity (knowledge) and level of performance (measurable through actions such as logic and reasoning) is hardly new. In fact, this is the very basis of Alchemy in ancient times, and has been practiced by extremely few great minds since the birth of humanity. 

My hypothesis in pursuing this experiment is that one may indeed increase both their capacity for knowledge and level of mental performance, as well as organise, analyse, and manage thoughts, processes, and gain complete control over their reality by utilising a suitable system.

Rather paradoxically, this experiment will include my following of various proposed systems until I am capable of meeting the criterions outlined below; when I am able to do so, the hypothesis will have been proven true and thus a straight-line system for achieving control over the mind will have been created – I am trying to train my brain to perform better, and in so doing, hope to unveil the very system which is hypothesised.

## Aims
No experiment is without its aims. They are as follows:
1.	Improve:
    1.	memory (storage and effective retrieval of knowledge)
    2.	processing speed (level at which the brain is capable of performing tasks)
    3.	decision-making (accuracy and verity of logic and reasoning)
3.	Devise a system which allows one to effectively improve qualities i, ii, and iii.

## Basic Methodology
Although methodologies for every individual proposed strategy will be different, the basic methodology of the experiment is as follows:
1.	Gain an insight into the nature of the human mind and its condition of consciousness.
2.	Understand the mind’s processes and its triggers, likes, dislikes, tendencies, etc.
3.	Devise strategies on how to manage the mind’s various functions in a manner that is more efficient and allows for effective fulfilment of outlined aims.
4.	Implement, practice, document, and modify or exclude said strategy, depending on performance.

## Closing Thoughts
With the introduction finalised, let us commence the pursuit of discovery.
